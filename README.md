# NBA-Adj-Value

For this project, I sought to create a measure of “value” for each player in the NBA using a weighted formula consisting of O-PIPM, D-PIPM, O-RAPTOR, and D-RAPTOR. My findings are in line with the league’s shift towards tall playmakers who can make their presence felt on both ends in a variety of ways. I web scraped data from FiveThirtyEight and BBall Index to acquire the requisite data. Value is in units of per 100 possessions and accounts for age, positional league averages, amongst other factors.
